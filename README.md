# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
To create entity relationship diagrams (ERDs), import data into a database, troubleshoot common errors, and create queries that use data to answer questions to perform employee research to determine who will be retiring and how many vacancies need to be filled, build an employee database with sql by applying data modeling, engineering and analysis skills.
### Purpose:
To determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
## Results:
both managers want to try a new mentoring program for employees getting ready to retire. Instead of having a large chunk of their workforce retiring, they want to introduce a mentoring program: experienced and successful employees stepping back into a part-time role instead of retiring completely. Their new role in the company would be as a mentor to the newly hired folks.

## Summary:

The summary addresses the two questions and contains two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight. (5 pt)
